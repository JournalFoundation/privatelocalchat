// device", and the limits below decide only when a voice is labelled "may be slow here" or reported as slow after download. The probe and speed limits were
// calibrated on real devices and simulated slow CPUs (docs/VOICE-CALIBRATION.md); the others remain conservative values.

  // stage 3 (after install). Real time is NICE, NOT REQUIRED (owner decision, 2026-11-02): a voice slower than playback is kept as long as playback can

  maxFirstAudioMs: 4000,     // advice threshold: the sweep gives first audio of 2.7 s (Kitten) and 1.9 s (Kokoro) at their probe limits, so 4000 is a factor of 1.5 or more above those
  maxStartDelayMs: 10000,    // policy value (owner), not a measurement: longest wait before gapless playback of a typical 20 s reply may begin (see startDelayMs)
  qualityMinMemoryGB: 8,     // placeholder: memory (or unknown on desktop) needed for the larger voice
  qualityProbeMaxMs: 200     // advice threshold for recommending the larger voice (or a real GPU adapter). Measured: Kokoro factor x probe ms is about 235 (sweep, 4 threads) and 300 to 317 on the real desktops
                             // (Centroid 2.31x at 137 ms, Boiler 2.00x at 150 ms); the start delay stays under maxStartDelayMs up to a probe of about 317 ms (190 ms with 1 thread). 200 keeps a factor of 1.0 to 1.6 and the
