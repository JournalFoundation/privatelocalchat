// Logical memory management for every model that can sit in memory (chat model, voice, matching/embedding models, later image and OCR models).
//
// There are exactly two behaviours, chosen by the person in Settings, and nothing in between:
//   "keep"           the app tries to do whatever is asked, even if that is too much for the device; it says what is happening and, if it fails, why.
//   "one-at-a-time"  before a model is used, every other model is unloaded (their files stay on the device) and waits for one that is busy to finish.
//                    Models load again, lazily, the next time they are used. This costs time and gives the model in use the whole device.
// There is no automatic or predictive mode: the manager never guesses what will fit.
//
// The manager never loads anything. Each model kind keeps its own loading, progress and error handling and registers a "resident":
//   { id, kind, label (string | () => string), state() -> "unloaded"|"loading"|"loaded"|"busy"|"unloading"|"faulted",
//     unload() -> Promise, isBusy() -> boolean, estimateBytes?() -> number|null}
// There are no exceptions: whichever model is about to be used makes every other model unload, however small it is.
// A model asks for the device with `acquire(id)`, holds the lease while it works and calls `lease.release()` when done.
