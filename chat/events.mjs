// The page's event list: the named points where one feature lets the others take part. A feature adds a listener with events.on(name, fn); the chat core (and any
// feature) fires an event by name. Asking for a name that is not in the list below is an error, so a typo fails at once instead of doing nothing.
//
//   name              how it fires    arguments             what it is for
//   thread:selected   emit            (thread)              a conversation was shown: stop speech, close the canvas, refresh the presets
//   send:before       emit            ()                    a message is being sent, before the composer is read and cleared (dictation stops here)
//   send:intercept    intercept       (text, thread)        answer a message without the model; a listener returns true when it handled it (slash commands)
//   prompt:ready      emitAwait       (message)             a user message before it is kept or edited: tools rewrite it, the voice call marks it
//   context:collect   collect         (thread, view)        add to what the model is told: each returns { preamble?, attachmentText?, sources? }
//   reply:start       emit            (thread, message)     a reply began
//   reply:text        emit            (thread, fullText)    the reply so far (the voice call speaks it while it is written)
//   reply:end         emit            (thread, message)     the reply finished, stopped or failed
//
// emit: runs every listener in order and never lets one listener's error stop the others (it is logged). emitAwait / collect / intercept wait for each listener in turn
// and let errors through, because the caller depends on their answers.
