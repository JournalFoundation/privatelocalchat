// Where the small embedding model comes from, and what it is. This is the ONE place that names the host and the version.
//
// The model files and the ONNX Runtime WASM are a content-addressed set served from this project's own asset host (R2 bucket
// privatelocalchat-assets, published and verified by ops/cloudflare/publish-embedding.py): the version below is the first 16 hex digits of the
// SHA-256 of every file's path and hash, so a changed byte is a new path and the objects are immutable. The host sends CORS (`*`), which the
// app's cross-origin isolation (COEP) accepts for the worker's CORS-mode fetches.
//
// To change the set: publish it under https://assets.privatelocal.chat/models/memory/<version>/ first (docs/EMBEDDINGS.md), verify it,
// then change the version below. Nothing else needs to change.
