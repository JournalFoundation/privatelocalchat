// Gapless playback of synthesised audio: chunks (Float32Array + sample rate) are queued as AudioBuffers and each one starts exactly
// where the previous one ends. The AudioContext is injected so this can be tested without a browser.

// On iPhone and iPad a page's Web Audio is, by default, "ambient": the ringer switch (silent mode) mutes it and, after the microphone was used, it can go to the
// quiet earpiece instead of the speaker. The system voice is not affected, which made downloaded voices look silent unless headphones were plugged in.
// navigator.audioSession.type = "playback" (Safari 16.4+) says "this is media the person asked to hear": it plays through the speaker, ignoring the ringer switch.
// It is set while a player is playing and put back afterwards. A count keeps overlapping players from restoring it under each other.
// A second, independent route for the same promise: on iOS the sound is also sent through an <audio> element (a MediaStream from the page's audio graph). A media
// element plays as "media", which the ringer switch does not mute, and it works on iOS versions that have no audioSession. Used on iPhone and iPad only: other
// browsers play straight to the speakers as before.
