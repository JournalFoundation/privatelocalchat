# Really small models for the Galaxy S8+ and the iPhone 11 Pro

Started 2026-11-03. **Status: published and verified on desktop, the Galaxy S8+, the iPhone 15 Pro (processor) and the iPhone 11 Pro (first run)** (see Results and To do).

## Why

The smallest model was 901 MB (Granite 4.0 H 1B), the 2B Qwen is 1.2 GB. The S8+ has about 430 MB of free storage and no usable GPU adapter; the iPhone 11 Pro has no WebGPU and about 1 GB of browser quota, and the app refuses CPU models on iPhone and iPad (memory limit). Neither phone could run any model.

## What was decided, and why

- **Licence first.** Policy (memory `licence-policy-apache-open-source`): Apache-2.0 and MIT are accepted; custom licences are not without the owner's say-so. An outside suggestion put Gemma 3 270M first, but its licence is the Gemma terms (custom), and Falcon-H1-Tiny and LFM2.5-350M are "other" licences. **Not added.** SmolLM2 and Granite 4.0 H 350M are Apache-2.0.
- **Test in the app's own runtime, not a demo.** `work/probe-gguf.mjs` loads a GGUF through the real host worker and the retained wllama build on the CPU path and chats with it (the files are served by a small local server because Playwright's `route.fulfill` cannot carry a body over about 100 MB). All three candidates loaded:

| Model (file) | Size | Desktop CPU | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| SmolLM2-135M-Instruct Q4_K_M | 105 MB | about 10 tok/s | capital right, follow-up right, wordy; wrong on "three primary colours" |
| SmolLM2-360M-Instruct Q4_0 | 230 MB | about 5 tok/s | correct, terse; slower than Granite 350M at the same size, so not added |
| **Granite 4.0 H 350M Q4_K_M** | 223 MB | about 12 tok/s | correct and short on all four questions |

- **Two tiers:** `mini` = Granite 4.0 H 350M (try first), `nano` = SmolLM2-135M (smallest, weakest; for when storage is the limit). Both are single files, published unchanged from IBM's and bartowski's repositories at pinned commits (`ops/cloudflare/gguf-models.json`, `publish-gguf.py`), served from `assets.privatelocal.chat`, listed in `models/catalog.json`.
- **Policy change in `runtime/auto-tier.mjs`:** the tiny tiers may run on the processor on iPhone/iPad and with 2 GB of memory; the 2B and 1B models still may not. A phone with no usable graphics card now starts with `mini`; a desktop without one keeps `light`; a person's choice and an already downloaded model keep their place. The backend (processor or card) is decided per model (`tierBackend`).

## Results

- **Desktop, real app, from the CDN** (`docs/evidence/model-nano-cdn-check.json`, `model-mini-cdn-check.json`; and `tests/e2e/tiny-models.e2e.mjs`, a release check): download, SHA-256 check, load, answers, unload, remove: all pass for both.
- **Galaxy S8+ (Android 9, Chrome 131, 3.4 GB RAM, about 519 MB free, no GPU adapter)**, the real first-run flow on the dev site (`docs/evidence/small-models/s8plus.json`): the app picked `mini` by itself, downloaded it (about 10 minutes on that phone's connection; free space 519 -> 283 MB), loaded it and answered "The capital of France is Paris."; the follow-up ("Italy?") took 12 s and said "Rome". With the network denied (dev switch) a cold start showed the Offline pill, the checklist said "Ready for offline use", and it answered (the reply, "Good evening.", is a small-model quirk). The model was removed afterwards (free space back to about 492 MB). Before this change no model could be offered there: the 1.2 GB download did not fit.
- **iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 26.6.2), tiny models forced onto the processor** (the way the 11 Pro would run them; `docs/evidence/small-models/iphone15pro-cpu.json`): both load in about 1 s and the browser did not end the page. `mini` about 21 tokens/s, `nano` about 32 tokens/s, single thread; both answered the capital and the follow-up; `nano` rambled on the meeting question and `mini` gave "Friday" (no time). So `mini` is the one to offer first, and `nano` is only for when storage or memory is the limit.
- **iPhone 11 Pro (iOS 18.6.2)**, in the Safari automation session (`docs/evidence/small-models/iphone11pro.json`). The owner's own tab showed the same failure ("unknown transient reason"), so this session is a faithful stand-in. Here `navigator.storage.getDirectory()` (OPFS, where models are normally kept) throws on every call, from the page and from a worker, and IndexedDB cannot store Blobs (plain bytes work); the Cache API works; the phone has 3.2 GB free, so it is not space.
  - The app used to blame memory ("the default model needs about 6 GB"); `runtime/providers/errors.mjs` now classifies it as "storage unavailable" (`tests/storage-unavailable.test.mjs`).
  - **Fallback storage** (`runtime/providers/cache-api-backend.mjs`, `tests/cache-api-backend.test.mjs`, `tests/e2e/no-opfs.e2e.mjs`): when OPFS cannot be opened, wllama's cache manager uses the Cache API. It hands back the same Blob while the runtime re-opens the source file and lets go of it after the load.
  - **What fits:** the 223 MB Granite 350M downloaded and passed its checksum but froze the page while loading (twice, once at the very end of the download): the device is at its memory limit with a model that size in memory. The **105 MB SmolLM2-135M downloaded, loaded and answered**, and the real first-run flow (send "hi", change nothing) answered "Hello! I'm here to help you with any math or science-related questions…" in 22 s.
  - **Rule:** the device probe records whether OPFS can be opened (`env.opfs`); with no usable graphics card and OPFS unavailable the picker defaults to `nano` (`runtime/auto-tier.mjs`, `tests/cpu-backend.test.mjs`, `tests/opfs-probe.test.mjs`). A person's choice and a saved model keep their place; where OPFS works the phone still gets `mini`.

## To do

- [x] Galaxy S8+: download, chat, second turn, offline reopen, cleanup (2026-11-03).
- [x] iPhone, processor path for the tiny models, on a real iPhone (15 Pro, forced) (2026-11-03).
- [x] iPhone 11 Pro: first run in the automation session answers with `nano` (2026-11-03). **Confirmed by the owner in a normal Safari tab on the real phone (2026-11-03): sent "hi", the app loaded SmolLM2-135M and replied.** Not yet checked: that the model survives a force-quit.
- [x] Measured speeds in the catalogue notes (memory is still an estimate: no tool here reads a phone page's memory).
- [x] The unhelpful "needs 6 GB" message for a failed storage call.

## Log

- 2026-11-03: candidates tested, `mini` and `nano` published to the CDN and added to the app; desktop checks pass; unit tests 1,023 pass.
- 2026-11-03: S8+ and iPhone 15 Pro (processor) results in; found that OPFS is unavailable in the 11 Pro's Safari automation session and fixed the misleading error text.
- 2026-11-03: iPhone 11 Pro: OPFS and IndexedDB-Blob unavailable; Cache API fallback; 223 MB froze, 105 MB works; default rule added; the development diagnostics panel (broken since the model panel was removed) fixed on the way.
- 2026-11-03: the owner confirmed the iPhone 11 Pro works in a normal tab: "hi" loads SmolLM2-135M and gets a reply.
